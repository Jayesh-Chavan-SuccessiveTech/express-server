# VS-CODE

> Since its release in 2015, Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code has quickly established itself as the most popular code editor out there. In the last two years, evidence from Google’s search trends would indicate that interest in VS Code has overtaken that of all other major text editors

## Features

1. The Integrated CLI (Command Line Interface)

    > To save switching between windows, VS Code offers an integrated terminal or CLI. Simply, press CNTRL + ' or CMD + ' to open it up, and the same command to close it. It will automatically open in the directory you have open in VS Code, which saves the navigation step required for operations in a standard terminal.

    > This makes it easy to install NPM or Yarn dependencies, commit files to Git, and push files to Github — as well as anything else you might want to do via the command line!

2. ESLint

    > ESLint is a powerful and popular linting tool, which helps you spot errors in your code and fix them as you write and which helps you follow common best-practices. It’s also a great learning tool, since researching ESLint errors has taught me many best practices I didn’t know before, and it’s helped me understand why they are best practices.

3. Multi-Cursor Shortcuts

    > The ability to edit with multiple cursors can be a huge time saver. To use this most effectively requires memorisation of a handful of commands, but they’ll soon become second nature.

4. Execute and Debug JavaScript

    > There are several great options for executing and debugging JavaScript within Visual Code studio.

5. Emmet Abbreviations

    > These useful shortcuts come built-in to VS Code, and they make writing HTML (and CSS) a lot faster.

## Plugins

1. npm Intellisense

    > VS Code plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements.

2. SVG Viewer

    > SVG Viewer for VS Code.

3. Git History

    > View your Git log and file history. You’re also able to compare branches or commits.

4. Live Share

    > Visual Studio Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time, regardless of what programming languages you’re using or app types you’re building.

5. Code Spell Checker

    > The goal of this spell checker is to help catch common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low.

6. Remote - SSH

    > Open any folder on a remote machine using SSH, and take advantage of VS Code’s full feature set.
    > The Remote - SSH extension lets you use any remote machine with an SSH server as your development environment. This can greatly simplify development and troubleshooting in a wide variety of situations.

7. Import Cost

    > This extension will display inline in the editor the size of the imported package. The extension utilizes webpack with Babili Webpack Plugin in order to detect the imported size.

8. Settings Sync

    > Synchronize settings, snippets, themes, file icons, launch, keybindings, workspaces, and extensions across multiple machines using GitHub gists.
